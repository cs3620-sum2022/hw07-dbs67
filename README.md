## Homework Description

Implement a concrete class for the `StackInterface`.  Use the PHP native array for the implementation.

## Steps

You must write code in the class Stack, inside `Stack.php`.
The functions that are to be implemented by you are marked with a `// TODO`.

- Run `composer install` once you are in the Docker container.
- Next run `composer test` to see all the errors you'll need to correct.

## Files To Work On

You are required to work on `README.md` and `/src/Stack.php`
Please **DO NOT MODIFY** any other files. Modifying any other file will result in penalty to your grade.

### Notes

- Make sure your project runs. There are no points for code that doesn't run.
- The Initial template code will compile, but will fail in most of the test cases.
- Make sure your last push is before the deadline. Your last push will be considered as your final submission.
- Post questions in Discussions on Canvas if you have any questions.
